# Google Form to Filemaker

Google Sheet compatible javascript function for posting to Filemaker Server using http, on a form submit. The function is designed to be installed and used in the Google Sheet the Google Form is using to collect responses.

The example form can be found at http://links.carterbrooks.com/GoogleFormToFilemaker_GoogleForm

The Filemaker File can be browsed, using Filemaker Pro or Filemaker Go at http://links.carterbrooks.com/GoogleFormToFilemaker_FilemakerFile

There is often a short lag between a form being submitted and the trigger being executed.

## Getting Started

The javascript is designed to be installed as a ".gs" or script in a google project. When added to a Google Sheet that is the response destination for a Google Form, it can be used in the onSubmit trigger to post the Google Form's data to a Filemaker database.

### Prerequisites

A Filemaker file on Filemaker Server, configured to accept data through the REST api.
